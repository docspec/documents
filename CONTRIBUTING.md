## Attribution format

When adding entries, edit `ATTRIBUTION.json` (the `ATTRIBUTION.md` file is generated from it).

### `ATTRIBUTION.json` Format

```json
{
  "format": "docx",
  "path": "documents/docx/examples/my-document.docx",
  "title": "Document Title",
  "author": "Jane Smith",
  "license": "CC-BY-4.0",
  "source": "https://example.com/original-url",
  "tags": ["tables", "images", "formatting"],
  "donated": "2026-02-17",
  "notes": "Contains complex table layouts and embedded images"
}
```

## What makes a good test document?

Ideal documents have:

- **Interesting formatting**: Tables, images, footnotes, headers/footers
- **Complex structures**: Nested lists, mixed formatting, equations
- **Real-world content**: Actual documents, not artificial test files
- **Edge cases**: Unusual or challenging formatting
- **Variety**: Different languages, scripts, styles

## Questions?

- Not sure about licensing? Ask in an [issue](../../issues/new/choose)
- Need help with format? We're happy to assist
- Want to donate but have concerns? Just ask!
