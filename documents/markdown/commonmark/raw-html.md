## Raw HTML


Text between `<` and `>` that looks like an HTML tag is parsed as a
raw HTML tag and will be rendered in HTML without escaping.
Tag and attribute names are not limited to current HTML tags,
so custom tags (and even, say, DocBook tags) may be used.

Here is the grammar for tags:

A [tag name](@) consists of an ASCII letter
followed by zero or more ASCII letters, digits, or
hyphens (`-`).

An [attribute](@) consists of spaces, tabs, and up to one line ending,
an [attribute name], and an optional
[attribute value specification].

An [attribute name](@)
consists of an ASCII letter, `_`, or `:`, followed by zero or more ASCII
letters, digits, `_`, `.`, `:`, or `-`.  (Note:  This is the XML
specification restricted to ASCII.  HTML5 is laxer.)

An [attribute value specification](@)
consists of optional spaces, tabs, and up to one line ending,
a `=` character, optional spaces, tabs, and up to one line ending,
and an [attribute value].

An [attribute value](@)
consists of an [unquoted attribute value],
a [single-quoted attribute value], or a [double-quoted attribute value].

An [unquoted attribute value](@)
is a nonempty string of characters not
including spaces, tabs, line endings, `"`, `'`, `=`, `<`, `>`, or `` ` ``.

A [single-quoted attribute value](@)
consists of `'`, zero or more
characters not including `'`, and a final `'`.

A [double-quoted attribute value](@)
consists of `"`, zero or more
characters not including `"`, and a final `"`.

An [open tag](@) consists of a `<` character, a [tag name],
zero or more [attributes], optional spaces, tabs, and up to one line ending,
an optional `/` character, and a `>` character.

A [closing tag](@) consists of the string `</`, a
[tag name], optional spaces, tabs, and up to one line ending, and the character
`>`.

An [HTML comment](@) consists of `<!-->`, `<!--->`, or  `<!--`, a string of
characters not including the string `-->`, and `-->` (see the
[HTML spec](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/parsing.html#markup-declaration-open-state)).

A [processing instruction](@)
consists of the string `<?`, a string
of characters not including the string `?>`, and the string
`?>`.

A [declaration](@) consists of the string `<!`, an ASCII letter, zero or more
characters not including the character `>`, and the character `>`.

A [CDATA section](@) consists of
the string `<![CDATA[`, a string of characters not including the string
`]]>`, and the string `]]>`.

An [HTML tag](@) is an [open tag], a [closing tag],
an [HTML comment], a [processing instruction], a [declaration],
or a [CDATA section].

Here are some simple open tags:

```````````````````````````````` example
<a><bab><c2c>
.
<p><a><bab><c2c></p>
````````````````````````````````


Empty elements:

```````````````````````````````` example
<a/><b2/>
.
<p><a/><b2/></p>
````````````````````````````````


Whitespace is allowed:

```````````````````````````````` example
<a  /><b2
data="foo" >
.
<p><a  /><b2
data="foo" ></p>
````````````````````````````````


With attributes:

```````````````````````````````` example
<a foo="bar" bam = 'baz <em>"</em>'
_boolean zoop:33=zoop:33 />
.
<p><a foo="bar" bam = 'baz <em>"</em>'
_boolean zoop:33=zoop:33 /></p>
````````````````````````````````


Custom tag names can be used:

```````````````````````````````` example
Foo <responsive-image src="foo.jpg" />
.
<p>Foo <responsive-image src="foo.jpg" /></p>
````````````````````````````````


Illegal tag names, not parsed as HTML:

```````````````````````````````` example
<33> <__>
.
<p>&lt;33&gt; &lt;__&gt;</p>
````````````````````````````````


Illegal attribute names:

```````````````````````````````` example
<a h*#ref="hi">
.
<p>&lt;a h*#ref=&quot;hi&quot;&gt;</p>
````````````````````````````````


Illegal attribute values:

```````````````````````````````` example
<a href="hi'> <a href=hi'>
.
<p>&lt;a href=&quot;hi'&gt; &lt;a href=hi'&gt;</p>
````````````````````````````````


Illegal whitespace:

```````````````````````````````` example
< a><
foo><bar/ >
<foo bar=baz
bim!bop />
.
<p>&lt; a&gt;&lt;
foo&gt;&lt;bar/ &gt;
&lt;foo bar=baz
bim!bop /&gt;</p>
````````````````````````````````


Missing whitespace:

```````````````````````````````` example
<a href='bar'title=title>
.
<p>&lt;a href='bar'title=title&gt;</p>
````````````````````````````````


Closing tags:

```````````````````````````````` example
</a></foo >
.
<p></a></foo ></p>
````````````````````````````````


Illegal attributes in closing tag:

```````````````````````````````` example
</a href="foo">
.
<p>&lt;/a href=&quot;foo&quot;&gt;</p>
````````````````````````````````


Comments:

```````````````````````````````` example
foo <!-- this is a --
comment - with hyphens -->
.
<p>foo <!-- this is a --
comment - with hyphens --></p>
````````````````````````````````

```````````````````````````````` example
foo <!--> foo -->

foo <!---> foo -->
.
<p>foo <!--> foo --&gt;</p>
<p>foo <!---> foo --&gt;</p>
````````````````````````````````


Processing instructions:

```````````````````````````````` example
foo <?php echo $a; ?>
.
<p>foo <?php echo $a; ?></p>
````````````````````````````````


Declarations:

```````````````````````````````` example
foo <!ELEMENT br EMPTY>
.
<p>foo <!ELEMENT br EMPTY></p>
````````````````````````````````


CDATA sections:

```````````````````````````````` example
foo <![CDATA[>&<]]>
.
<p>foo <![CDATA[>&<]]></p>
````````````````````````````````


Entity and numeric character references are preserved in HTML
attributes:

```````````````````````````````` example
foo <a href="&ouml;">
.
<p>foo <a href="&ouml;"></p>
````````````````````````````````


Backslash escapes do not work in HTML attributes:

```````````````````````````````` example
foo <a href="\*">
.
<p>foo <a href="\*"></p>
````````````````````````````````


```````````````````````````````` example
<a href="\"">
.
<p>&lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&quot;&gt;</p>
````````````````````````````````


A block quote can prevent a line from being parsed as inline HTML,
even though line breaks are allowed in tags:

```````````````````````````````` example
<a
> quoted text
.
<p>&lt;a</p>
<blockquote>
<p>quoted text</p>
</blockquote>
````````````````````````````````
